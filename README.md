Computer Vision Projects using Java

CV_P2_autoThresholdSelection: 
implement the automatic threshold selection method: the bi-Gaussian curve fitting of a given histogram.

CV_P5_EdgeDetectors: 
Robert, Sobel and Gradient Edge Detectors.

CV_P7_DistLocalMaximaDeCompress: 
Given a binary image, the task is to produce a loss-less compression of the input image via the skeleton of 8-connectness distance transform.

CV_P9_HoughTransform: 
implement the Hough Transform for line detection algorithm.
Hough Transform is a mapping from “lines” (on the image) to points (on the Hough Space). All object pixels located on the same line (i.e. co-linear pixels) are mapped (voted) onto a single bucket [angle, distance] in the Hough Space, where angle is the angle of the line passing thru these co-linear pixels and distance is the orthogonal distance from the origin to that line.
